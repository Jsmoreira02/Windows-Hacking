# PyEnum - Windows Privilege Escalation Enumeration Script

## Introduction

**PyEnum** is a Python script that helps you quickly spot possible ways to escalate privileges on a Windows machine. It's inspired by tools like PEASS-ng and guides like HackTricks. The goal is to find common misconfigurations, weak permissions, and sensitive data that could be exploited.

Use it only for learning or on systems youâ€™re allowed to test.
flaws, and potentially sensitive data across a Windows host.

It is intended for **educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only**.

## Features

- Scans for misconfigurations that could let someone escalate privileges
- Searches for credentials and secrets buried in files
- Lets you filter by file type
- Uses colors to make results easier to read
- Built to be modular, so you can add your own stuff

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download and run the script on a PowerShell-compatible Windows system.

```python
git clone https://your-repo-url
cd your-repo
python3 PyEnum.py
```

or

```python
git clone https://your-repo-url
cd your-repo
make
.\PyEnum.exe
```

## Usage

```python
# Run a basic scan
python3 PyEnum.py

# Look for saved passwords or usernames
python3 PyEnum.py --credentials

# Search specific file types
python3 PyEnum.py --credentials --extensions ".txt,.xml"

# Just search for certain file extensions
python3 PyEnum.py --search --extensions ".docx,.ini"

# Need help?
python3 PyEnum.py --help
```

## How It Works

The script checks a few common ways attackers try to escalate privileges:

### ðŸ”¹ Filesystem and Drive Scanning

- Checking Files and Drives
- Looks for files that might have passwords or secrets using keywords.
- Scans for extensions like `.txt`, `.xml`, `.config`
- Tries to spot things like:
  - `password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`, `username`
  - Regex-based matching to identify hardcoded credentials and tokens.

### ðŸ”¹ Registry and Service Misconfigurations

- Detects possible misconfigurations that may be exploited by attackers, such as:
  - Weak registry permissions
  - Services with unquoted paths
  - Auto-run registry keys

### ðŸ”¹ Local User and Group Enumeration

- Checks current user privileges
- Looks for users in admin groups they probably shouldnâ€™t be in

### ðŸ”¹ Script Injection and Auto-Elevated Binaries

- Highlights potentially injectable paths
- Looks for binaries or scripts run by higher-privilege users

## Dependencies

- Python3 or superior installed
- Administrator privileges enhance discovery but are not required for basic enumeration
- You can compile with pyinstaller and run an .exe

## Examples

```python
# Search for credentials in .ini and .conf files
python3 PyEnum.py --credentials --extensions ".ini,.conf"
```

```python
# Just search for all .txt and .docx files
python3 PyEnum.py --search --extensions ".txt,.docx"
```

## Troubleshooting

  - **False Positives:** The script looks for patterns, so some results might need a second look.
  - **Permission Problems:** Some files or areas might need admin rights to access.
